### rpi-io-control

Usage:

- install the pi-blaster daemon (if you want to use PWM)
- npm install
- node app.js
- this starts listening on port 3001. Visit it in a webkit browser and you'll have a nifty ui to read, write, and write with pwm on your pi. 

* This is only tested on the normal raspbian distro. It's only on github in case something happens to the pi and I lose the project.
